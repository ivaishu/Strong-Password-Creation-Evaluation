## âœ… Best Practices

### 1. Use Long Passwords
- Minimum **12â€“16 characters** recommended.
- Longer passwords exponentially increase cracking time.

### 2. Mix Character Types
- Include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols

### 3. Avoid Common Words & Patterns
- Do not use:
  - Names
  - Birthdays
  - Keyboard patterns (`qwerty`, `12345`)

### 4. Use Passphrases
- Combine random words into a phrase.
- Example: `HorseBatteryCoffee!Moon`

### 5. Donâ€™t Reuse Passwords
- Each account should have a **unique password**.

### 6. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Even if your password is stolen, MFA adds an extra layer of security.

### 7. Use a Password Manager
- Tools like Bitwarden, KeePass, or LastPass can generate and store strong passwords.

### 8. Change Passwords If Compromised
- Use services like [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to check for breaches.
