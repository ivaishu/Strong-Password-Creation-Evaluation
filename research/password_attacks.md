## ðŸ›  Types of Password Attacks

### 1. **Brute Force Attack**
- **Description:** Tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
- **Speed Factors:** Depends on password length, complexity, and attacker resources (e.g., GPU speed).
- **Prevention:**
  - Use long and complex passwords.
  - Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts.

---

### 2. **Dictionary Attack**
- **Description:** Uses a precompiled list of common words, phrases, and leaked passwords to guess credentials.
- **Prevention:**
  - Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.
  - Add symbols and numbers in non-obvious positions.

---

### 3. **Credential Stuffing**
- **Description:** Uses stolen username-password pairs from one breach to try logging into other services.
- **Prevention:**
  - Never reuse passwords across accounts.
  - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

---

### 4. **Phishing**
- **Description:** Tricks users into revealing passwords through fake login pages or malicious emails.
- **Prevention:**
  - Verify website URLs.
  - Educate users about phishing indicators.

---

### 5. **Keylogging**
- **Description:** Malicious software records keystrokes to steal entered passwords.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use updated antivirus software.
  - Avoid logging in from untrusted devices.

---

### 6. **Rainbow Table Attack**
- **Description:** Uses precomputed hashes of passwords to quickly find matches in stolen hash databases.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use salted password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
