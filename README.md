# Strong-Password-Creation-Evaluation

# 🔐 Strong Password Creation & Evaluation

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to create strong passwords, evaluate their strength using online tools, and understand best practices for password security.  
It is part of my Cybersecurity Internship tasks, focusing on **password security, complexity, and protection against attacks**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Create multiple passwords with different complexity levels.
- Test each password with free online password strength checkers.
- Record scores and feedback.
- Research common password attacks and prevention methods.
- Document best practices for creating secure passwords.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
- [NordPass Password Strength Tester](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-checker/)

## 📖 Methodology
1. **Password Creation**
   - Generated passwords with varying length, symbols, numbers, uppercase, lowercase.
2. **Testing**
   - Evaluated passwords using online tools.
   - Saved screenshots of results.
3. **Analysis**
   - Compared feedback from different tools.
4. **Research**
   - Studied password attack methods (brute force, dictionary attacks).
   - Documented strong password creation tips.

## 📊 Evaluation
| Password Example      | Strength Score | Feedback |
|----------------------|----------------|----------|
| `583644`             | 14% (Very Weak)     | Too short, common |
| `PassWord123`       | 79% (Strong)   | Good mix but common pattern |
| `ZM2lRcIy42Egk3P`     | 100% (Very Strong) | Complex, long, unique |
| `{nr66igRP,Y37]75[b`     | 100% (Very Strong) | Complex, long, unique |

## 🛡 Key Learnings
- Longer passwords are harder to crack.
- Avoid dictionary words and common substitutions.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
- Password managers help store and generate secure passwords.
